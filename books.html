        <div class="w3-container ">
          <p>"For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.</p>
          <p>Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life - until the unthinkable happens."</p>
          <p>Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</p>

              <p>This is a book I spotted in the bookshop and was intrigued, partly because I hadn't a clue what crawdads were and partly because I love a mystery to solve! It looks like we are all going to be spending more time indoors in the coming month, so what better time to read a challenging book like Where the Crawdads Sing? </p>

Until one day they are ripped apart by circumstances neither could have imagined. Roy is arrested and sentenced to twelve years for a crime Celestial knows he didn't commit.</p>

          <p>A masterpiece of storytelling, An American Marriage offers a profoundly insightful look into the hearts and minds of three unforgettable characters who are at once bound together and separated by forces beyond their control.</p>

            <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
              <p>When I read what this book is about, I was immediately intrigued by Celestial and Roy's story and wanted to know how it turned out. Emotions are already flying high and I've only got as far as the blurb - this is set to be a moving read.</p>
              <br>
            <div>
                <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
                <p><em>The blurb of this book tells you that a young couple will be separated early in their marriage, as the husband is put in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. Therefore, there were few surprises, as the story plays out as advertised. How the events affects the couple, and those nearest to them is what makes this book so gripping. The pain they, and all those nearest to them, go through in the book makes the reader reevaluate their priorities and consider the fragility of our lives. At a time when covid-19 is spreading globally, the ease with which your everyday existence can be turned on its head seems entirely relatable, and I felt for all the characters involved as their lives were changed forever.</p>
                  <p>Hearing the story from three different viewpoints enables the reader to understand how each character has come to their present state and the decisions they have made to get there. This should mean that we feel torn, as we understand each character’s motivations and perspectives. However, although the idea was promising and the subject matter moving, I felt that the style of writing, where the reader discovers everything that has happened after the event itself, and often from a different viewpoint, somehow disconnected me from the emotion in the story. I would have preferred to find out more about the characters up-front, rather than discovering about them as the book progressed, so I could build a picture of them early on and then would have more of an emotional response when events unfolded. This doesn’t detract from the important issues this book raises and the keenness with which I pressed on to the end. But for such a powerful storyline, and the three first-person narratives giving us access to their innermost thoughts, I expected to feel more invested in their outcomes.</em></p>
                <br>
                <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
                <p><em>Very good book, one which I would have picked to read myself. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.</p>
                  <p>It was an emotional read.  I would have liked a bit more about what it was like/what he faced in prison.  I loved Roy Snr and was cheering him when he kept Andre at his house!  When you watch programmes about wrongful convictions, you feel for the person sent to prison, but you don’t think about the effect it has on their loved ones.  Good read!</p>
                <p>9/10</em></p>
                <p>------</p>
                <p><em>This book centres on a miscarriage of justice and because of that, the complex lives of the three main characters are brought to life and woven together in a very honest way.</p>
                <p>I wasn’t sure about the narration being done by the characters at first but it certainly holds you to the end and keeps you guessing.</p>
                <p>7/10</em></p>
                <p>------</p>
                <p><em>This story is told by alternating reflections from the 3 main characters, Roy, Celeste and Andre as they are entwined in a serious love triangle. Roy is portrayed as a decent guy who suffers an unjust twist of fate. Andre is an old friend of both Celeste and Roy. Both men are infatuated with Celeste. As the story progresses their friendships and bonds are tested to the limits.</p>
                <p>I enjoyed this book but was surprisingly unmoved by it despite the enormity of the events unfolding and their relationships being tested to the limit.</p>
                <p>6.5/10</em></p>
                <p>------</p>
                <p><em>For me, this book was a bit like someone describing a photograph in the sense that the fundamental plot is already largely available to you before you start reading. Of course it is unclear what will happen in the end but as it’s not an overly plot driven narrative, the interest lies in the steady unfolding of how the lives of all of those involved are messily intertwined.</p>
                  <p>Although I thought it was a beautifully written book and particularly enjoyed the letter exchanges, I initially felt the same as Lucy in that if more had been given about the central characters earlier on, I too may have felt more emotionally connected to the various events that ensued.</p>
                  <p>However, on reflection, perhaps the sentiment that we, as the reader, feel like we aren’t given enough time to acquaint ourselves meaningfully with the central characters before Roy is arrested, reflects the way that Roy and Celestial were not given enough time to establish deep roots in their relationship before their time together was unjustly and cruelly ripped apart. I think Celestial, at one point, even refers to the relationship as being like a sapling that didn’t have chance to root (or something along those lines!) and this is repeatedly juxtaposed by the rock solid, rooted connectedness shown by Big Roy and Olive’s relationship. Our feeling of not knowing them well enough is arguably, to an extent, the same as what Celestial feels towards Roy. Even right at the beginning their argument stems from Roy not having told her about his real father. Therefore, although I initially felt puzzled as to why I wasn’t overly moved by such a moving set of events, I now feel like my sense of emotional disconnect is not just that, instead it serves to illuminate further why their relationship could not be.</p>

            <p>"In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.</p>
            <p>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.</p>
            <p>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</p>
            <p>With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world."</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
                <p>January's book was a challenging real-life story so I have tried to find something a little different for February. Circe takes us back thousands of years into the world of myth, following Odysseus' adventures home after the Trojan War, but from the perspective of Circe, a sorceress. The timeless themes of love, family, healing, choice and fate will be examined in this award-winning read.</p>
                <br>
              <div>
                  <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
                  <p><em>I haven’t read a “fantasy” style book in ages, and it took me longer than it should have to get into Circe, but it was definitely worth persisting. Circe is set in Ancient Greece and tells the story of an unusual goddess who doesn’t fit in among her own kind and instead is drawn towards mortals, seeking love and approval from them since she has not received it from the gods. The idea of a young person being born into a family they don’t fit with reminded me of Educated; both Tara and Circe struggle with their own kind and feel there is something else out there for them in an unfamiliar place; both find it hard to overcome the challenges the new place holds; both have to reconcile difficulties with their own family; and both eventually find a kind of harmony in their new life, having gained the strength to take it for themselves. Despite the mythological wrapper, Circe deals with contemporary themes and, at its core, is about a woman trying to make sense of the world and her place in it. It is a powerful read.</p>
                  <p>Circe’s status as a goddess adds emphasis to ordinary events in human life. The wrench she feels at her son growing up and entering the world is something felt by many parents, and I really felt her sadness as I read of Telegonus’ sailing off to find his father aged only 16. The fear Circe has of her son dying before her is one of the greatest fears of a parent’s life and the seeming inevitability of this, since her son is a demi-god and destined to die while she is immortal, heightens the emotion of this part of her story. The joy of having a son, someone to love her unconditionally in an existence where love has been lacking, turns into the greatest pain, that of losing a child. The fact that the greatest thing in her life can serve to increase the sadness she has experienced is heart-breaking and I felt that Miller highlighted this issue beautifully in the book.</p>
                  <p>The conclusion of the book again reminded me of contemporary issues and used the mythological world to make sense of them. In a family where she has always been mocked and used as a scapegoat, by the end of the book, Circe finally gathers the strength to stand up to her father and demand the end of her exile, showing great self-awareness and new-found confidence. In the final chapter, Miller doesn’t tell us whether Circe actually becomes mortal, but this doesn’t matter; the fact that she has come to terms with and is allowing herself to be true to her real self is empowering. Her characterisation throughout the book means that the reader goes through every trial with her and is glad that she has found her place at the end. If all readers come away questioning who they want to be in this world and having a keener awareness of their self-identity, as I certainly have, Miller will have triumphed.</em></p>
                  <br>
                  <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
                  <p><em>I can't say how accurately the original mythology of Circe was retold, only that the telling was powerful, gripping and fun. The book follows the goddess Circe from her birth and through her whole life, with lots of mini stories of her interactions with Greek heros and other gods throughout the aeons.</p><p> I was pleasantly surprised by the feminist perspective that the author gives Circe, which is circled back to multiple times throughout the story.  If you like Greek mythology and/or want an easy read I can highly recommend!<br>9/10</em></p>
                  <p>------</p>
                  <p><em>Circe....it hooked me in! I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next.</p>
                    <p>I felt for Circe as she had such a bad start in life at home being the most insignificant member of her family and therefore an outcast. She was unloved by all and very isolated and sought comfort from her brother and Glaucus who depended on her. She never got over the transformation of Scylla.</p>
                    <p>As a reader, the traumas she went through for no reason of her own affected me. I felt for her the whole way through. It was a fascinating tale and highlighted the many imperfections of the gods. It is very relevant to the modern day and the same challenges that Circe faced are still being faced today.<br>8/10</em></p>
                    <p>------</p>
                    <p><em>I’m glad I joined Lucy Reads as I would not have chosen this book myself. It revealed a world of mythology and magic. The text is intricately written with intensely evocative and descriptive writing depicting the imaginary world of gods, nymphs, mortals and monsters. Love and revenge, beauty and gore are richly portrayed in this adult ‘fairytale’.</p>
                    <p>The story is told by the protagonist , a sorceress called Circe. It depicts her life and travels, events and the gods and mortals that she becomes involved with. For me personally, it was rather too descriptive and complex with so many characters connected to so many others lives that I’m afraid that I ended up skipping several chapters in order to reach the end of the tale.<br>6/10</em></p>
                    <p>------</p>
                    <p><em>A completely different genre of book for me and, to be honest, I'm still not sure what I thought of it. It took me a while to get into it but I'm glad I persevered.<br>Thanks again for the suggestion.<br>7/10</em></p>
                    <p>------</p>
                    <p><em>This was the first mythology/ fantasy book I have read and I wasn't sure how I would get on with it. Initially I found it hard to get into but as the story progressed I got pulled into it.</p><p>I loved Circe. I found that she was very hard on herself for things she had done wrong and yet was so wronged by those who should have loved and protected her. She has so many amazing qualities such as being faithful, protective, loving, hard working, resourceful, selfless and so many more. I would definitely want to her on my side in a fight!</p><p>Once you get past the era and the characters you realise that this story has so many elements that we see in current day life such as power, wealth, love and jealousy. There is also the element of Circe being excluded for being different which is a very current theme. I didn't see the ending coming but I loved it. My advice would be to give it a go as it is worth it.</p><p>Thanks for introducing me to a different genre!<br>8/10</em></p>

          <p>“Tara Westover and her family grew up preparing for the End of Days but, according to the government, she didn’t exist. She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in hospitals.
            <br><br>
            As she grew older, her father became more radical and her brother more violent. At sixteen, Tara knew she had to leave home. In doing so she discovered both the transformative power of education, and the price she had to pay for it.”</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
                <p>This was on one of Obama's book lists in 2019, and was recommended to me by a friend. It is a true story, written by Tara Westover about her own experiences. It is incredible to think of the changes she made in her life, from never attending school to being awarded a PhD from Cambridge. I'm expecting to be shocked and inspired by her story.</p>
                <br>
                  <div>
                    <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
                      <p><em>Education both makes Tara who she is and alienates her from everything she has ever known. It is easy to look at the title of the book, hear how she escaped from a controlling Mormon family and ended up gaining a PhD from Cambridge and imagine some happy ending where getting a good education is the thing that saves her. However, as the book unfolds, it is clear that things aren’t that simple. Her family cannot accept the new Tara nor do they acknowledge her views, eventually leading to estrangement. Regardless of how extreme their views or abusive their actions, Tara finds it hard to let go of her family and spends a large portion of her adult life seeking their approval, gripped by an irrational yet completely understandable desire to retain her relationship with them. For me, the gradual alienation of her family as she becomes more educated is one of the most poignant aspects of the book - she may have gained the freedom to form her own views but she lost important figures in the process so any sense of achievement at the end of the book is bittersweet.</p>
                      <p>For a long time, Tara made excuses for her family, justifying their actions and sometimes even misremembering events so as not to face the truth of what they were doing. To be critical of one’s family is perhaps the hardest thing, and the danger of accepting her family’s ways unquestioningly was brought out in the book. The damage that the family did to Tara and the impact the events of her childhood had on her mental health are evident throughout. The more times she is told that she is wrong, the more she believes it, and I was particularly saddened in the part where Tara constantly tries to convince herself that she had remembered events wrongly, putting her intellect and its reliability into question. I believe that education is an important factor in social change, and it is clear that it is her intellect that enables Tara to escape from Buck’s Peak and take control of her life. When this is called into question and suggested to be unreliable, then it seemed that the family’s hold on Tara would continue. By this point, the “character” of Tara was such that I felt that I understood who she was and how she might think, and it is a triumph on her part that I genuinely felt concern for her at this point.</p>
                      <p>I found this book to be simultaneously gripping and troubling. Tara’s reflective tone is not nostalgic and the text isn’t full of explicit life lessons or expectations of pity. She doesn’t even present the actions of her father and brother, which already elicit a strong response from the reader, as shockingly as she could. Her aim is not to expose her family and their ways and have the reader admire her for her courage and her journey. She writes with honesty and gives the reader a clear vision of her life on the mountain that somehow makes sense of her actions throughout the book. To say I enjoyed the book seems to disrespect its contents, but I certainly felt engaged and challenged by it. I have thought about it a lot over the past month and am glad to have chosen it as the first read of the year.</em></p>

                      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
                        <p><em>Absolutely brilliant book! Loved the journey it took you on. You can’t comprehend that these things actually happened in her life. You champion her right to the end. Couldn’t put it down!<br>10/10</em></p>
                        <p>------</p>
                        <p><em>At times I could hardly bear to read on as the isolated, grim and abusive life that Tara endured as she was growing up was harrowingly described. Her later unfolding insights into the reasons why her parents behaved as they did were intelligently revealed  and the conflicts that she felt were bravely rationalised with the incredibly moving result of forging a separate and new life for herself. I was moved to tears at the end as I thought back to the terrible struggle she had endured and also the hope for a better future.<br>8/10</em></p>
                        <p>------</p>
                        <p><em>Crikey! I always avoid the ‘J Word cliche’ but this has definitely taken me on one heck of a journey.
                          So much to say... the first revelation being that I truly assumed at the beginning of the book that I was reading something set so much longer ago than it actually was!</p>
                          <p>I was hooked from beginning to end. Such powerful themes in the reflections of an adult through the eyes of the child she was.. were agonising, poignant and beggared belief??
                          A painfully vivid picture of the long term devastating impact that mental illness, isolation and extremism can have on every aspect of family life. So honestly and non-judgementally related.
                          I wanted to rush in to rescue Tara, find decent help for Shawn and offer stammering therapy to Tyler..!!
                          <p>An unforgettable read. Indeed - an education!!<br>10/10</em></p>
                          <p>------</p>
                          <p><em>Through reading this book I realised how little my own fundamental beliefs about life have ever been challenged, and am drawn to consider what my reaction might be to challenging an upbringing that taught me that my thoughts and existence were wrong.</p>
                            <p>Tara Westover's struggle to reconcile her desire for knowledge and truth with her love for her family and her understanding of how to be a good member within it is compellingly brutal as she battles duty with integrity, gaslighting with self-belief. Tales of horrific accidents befalling her brothers and father, and the violence she herself suffers are difficult to read, but I found the most challenging parts those where her increasingly varied experiences away from the mountain force her to confront her life there through the eyes of the world outside.</p>
                            <p>Her desire to love and be loved is palpable throughout, as is the pain when her mother and sister in particular turn their backs on her. Her fear of losing them is matched by their fear of a woman they no longer understand and whose knowledge of the modern world threatens their entire way of life. There is a primal struggle which has no obvious or right answer: whichever path Tara took risked loss and distress to herself and those she loves, and the real triumph is that she maintains her identity and sense of self throughout.<br>9/10</em></p>
                          <p>------</p>
                          <p><em>It's a story of indoctrination.  To some extent this happens to us all - we follow the beliefs and values instilled in us by our families. If it's all you've ever known, it must be true. It is only when you have another world for comparison that you begin to see that perhaps there are alternatives.</p>
                            <p>This is the story of a backwoods family, ruled by religious beliefs, sometimes taken to extremes, especially by Tara's father. His views on education outside the home, hospitals, doctors - authority figures; mostly based on fear of the unknown - he trusts no-one and his views are the only viable ones.</p>
                            <p>Tara does break free by taking the path of academia so abhorred by her father - and yet his influence has left her with nagging doubts about her choices.</p>
                            <p>Some of the conflicts in the Westover family were really hard to stomach - the denial of Shawn's violence difficult to believe - but symptomatic of the family's desire to close ranks.</p>
                            <p>Yet, Tara not only survived, but triumphed - but at what cost??<br>9/10</em></p>
                          <p>-----</p>
                          <p><em>A fantastic book - couldn't put it down! And it's not one I would have found myself, so thanks so much for the suggestion! I look forward to the next one!<br>10/10</em></p>
                          <p>-----</p>
                          <p><em>I loved this book and couldn't put it down. Tara is an amazing storyteller and she takes you on a complex and heartfelt journey giving some insight into her unique childhood and her journey to becoming educated. Through her eyes you realise that there were no easy answers to the difficult situations she found herself in or about the choices she had to make. I would highly recommend this book.<br>10/10</em></p>
                          <p>-----</p>
                          <p><em>A fascinating read! I was completely engrossed right from the start and it's not the sort of book I would usually choose.<br>10/10</em></p>
                          <p>-----</p>
                          <p><em>Unbelievably bad parenting!<br>10/10</em></p>
