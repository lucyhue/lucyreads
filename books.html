        <a href="books.html" class="nounderline"><h4>Educated by Tara Westover</h4></a>
      </div>

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>“Tara Westover and her family grew up preparing for the End of Days but, according to the government, she didn’t exist. She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in hospitals.
          <br><br>
          As she grew older, her father became more radical and her brother more violent. At sixteen, Tara knew she had to leave home. In doing so she discovered both the transformative power of education, and the price she had to pay for it.”</p>

          <br>
        <div>
          <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
          <p>This was on one of Obama's book lists in 2019, and was recommended to me by a friend. It is a true story, written by Tara Westover about her own experiences. It is incredible to think of the changes she made in her life, from never attending school to being awarded a PhD from Cambridge. I'm expecting to be shocked and inspired by her story.</p>
    <br>  <div>
        <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
        <p><em>Education both makes Tara who she is and alienates her from everything she has ever known. It is easy to look at the title of the book, hear how she escaped from a controlling Mormon family and ended up gaining a PhD from Cambridge and imagine some happy ending where getting a good education is the thing that saves her. However, as the book unfolds, it is clear that things aren’t that simple. Her family cannot accept the new Tara nor do they acknowledge her views, eventually leading to estrangement. Regardless of how extreme their views or abusive their actions, Tara finds it hard to let go of her family and spends a large portion of her adult life seeking their approval, gripped by an irrational yet completely understandable desire to retain her relationship with them. For me, the gradual alienation of her family as she becomes more educated is one of the most poignant aspects of the book - she may have gained the freedom to form her own views but she lost important figures in the process so any sense of achievement at the end of the book is bittersweet.</p>
          <p>For a long time, Tara made excuses for her family, justifying their actions and sometimes even misremembering events so as not to face the truth of what they were doing. To be critical of one’s family is perhaps the hardest thing, and the danger of accepting her family’s ways unquestioningly was brought out in the book. The damage that the family did to Tara and the impact the events of her childhood had on her mental health are evident throughout. The more times she is told that she is wrong, the more she believes it, and I was particularly saddened in the part where Tara constantly tries to convince herself that she had remembered events wrongly, putting her intellect and its reliability into question. I believe that education is an important factor in social change, and it is clear that it is her intellect that enables Tara to escape from Buck’s Peak and take control of her life. When this is called into question and suggested to be unreliable, then it seemed that the family’s hold on Tara would continue. By this point, the “character” of Tara was such that I felt that I understood who she was and how she might think, and it is a triumph on her part that I genuinely felt concern for her at this point.</p>
          <p>I found this book to be simultaneously gripping and troubling. Tara’s reflective tone is not nostalgic and the text isn’t full of explicit life lessons or expectations of pity. She doesn’t even present the actions of her father and brother, which already elicit a strong response from the reader, as shockingly as she could. Her aim is not to expose her family and their ways and have the reader admire her for her courage and her journey. She writes with honesty and gives the reader a clear vision of her life on the mountain that somehow makes sense of her actions throughout the book. To say I enjoyed the book seems to disrespect its contents, but I certainly felt engaged and challenged by it. I have thought about it a lot over the past month and am glad to have chosen it as the first read of the year.</em></p>
        <br>
        <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
        <p><em>Absolutely brilliant book! Loved the journey it took you on. You can’t comprehend that these things actually happened in her life. You champion her right to the end. Couldn’t put it down!<br>10/10</em></p>
        <p>------</p>
        <p><em>At times I could hardly bear to read on as the isolated, grim and abusive life that Tara endured as she was growing up was harrowingly described. Her later unfolding insights into the reasons why her parents behaved as they did were intelligently revealed  and the conflicts that she felt were bravely rationalised with the incredibly moving result of forging a separate and new life for herself. I was moved to tears at the end as I thought back to the terrible struggle she had endured and also the hope for a better future.<br>8/10</em></p>

    <a href="books.html" class="nounderline"><h4>Circe by Tara Madeline Miller</h4></a>
  </div>

  <div class="w3-container ">
    <p>"In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.</p>
    <p>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.</p>
    <p>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</p>
    <p>With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world."</p>

      <br>
    <div>
      <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
      <p>January's book was a challenging real-life story so I have tried to find something a little different for February. Circe takes us back thousands of years into the world of myth, following Odysseus' adventures home after the Trojan War, but from the perspective of Circe, a sorceress. The timeless themes of love, family, healing, choice and fate will be examined in this award-winning read.</p>
