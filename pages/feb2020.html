          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>"In the house of Helios, god of the sun and mightiest of the Titans, a daughter is born. But Circe is a strange child--not powerful, like her father, nor viciously alluring like her mother. Turning to the world of mortals for companionship, she discovers that she does possess power--the power of witchcraft, which can transform rivals into monsters and menace the gods themselves.</p>
          <p>Threatened, Zeus banishes her to a deserted island, where she hones her occult craft, tames wild beasts and crosses paths with many of the most famous figures in all of mythology, including the Minotaur, Daedalus and his doomed son Icarus, the murderous Medea, and, of course, wily Odysseus.</p>
          <p>But there is danger, too, for a woman who stands alone, and Circe unwittingly draws the wrath of both men and gods, ultimately finding herself pitted against one of the most terrifying and vengeful of the Olympians. To protect what she loves most, Circe must summon all her strength and choose, once and for all, whether she belongs with the gods she is born from, or the mortals she has come to love.</p>
          <p>With unforgettably vivid characters, mesmerizing language and page-turning suspense, Circe is a triumph of storytelling, an intoxicating epic of family rivalry, palace intrigue, love and loss, as well as a celebration of indomitable female strength in a man's world."</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
              <p>January's book was a challenging real-life story so I have tried to find something a little different for February. Circe takes us back thousands of years into the world of myth, following Odysseus' adventures home after the Trojan War, but from the perspective of Circe, a sorceress. The timeless themes of love, family, healing, choice and fate will be examined in this award-winning read.</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>I haven’t read a “fantasy” style book in ages, and it took me longer than it should have to get into Circe, but it was definitely worth persisting. Circe is set in Ancient Greece and tells the story of an unusual goddess who doesn’t fit in among her own kind and instead is drawn towards mortals, seeking love and approval from them since she has not received it from the gods. The idea of a young person being born into a family they don’t fit with reminded me of Educated; both Tara and Circe struggle with their own kind and feel there is something else out there for them in an unfamiliar place; both find it hard to overcome the challenges the new place holds; both have to reconcile difficulties with their own family; and both eventually find a kind of harmony in their new life, having gained the strength to take it for themselves. Despite the mythological wrapper, Circe deals with contemporary themes and, at its core, is about a woman trying to make sense of the world and her place in it. It is a powerful read.</p>
              <p>Circe’s status as a goddess adds emphasis to ordinary events in human life. The wrench she feels at her son growing up and entering the world is something felt by many parents, and I really felt her sadness as I read of Telegonus’ sailing off to find his father aged only 16. The fear Circe has of her son dying before her is one of the greatest fears of a parent’s life and the seeming inevitability of this, since her son is a demi-god and destined to die while she is immortal, heightens the emotion of this part of her story. The joy of having a son, someone to love her unconditionally in an existence where love has been lacking, turns into the greatest pain, that of losing a child. The fact that the greatest thing in her life can serve to increase the sadness she has experienced is heart-breaking and I felt that Miller highlighted this issue beautifully in the book.</p>
              <p>The conclusion of the book again reminded me of contemporary issues and used the mythological world to make sense of them. In a family where she has always been mocked and used as a scapegoat, by the end of the book, Circe finally gathers the strength to stand up to her father and demand the end of her exile, showing great self-awareness and new-found confidence. In the final chapter, Miller doesn’t tell us whether Circe actually becomes mortal, but this doesn’t matter; the fact that she has come to terms with and is allowing herself to be true to her real self is empowering. Her characterisation throughout the book means that the reader goes through every trial with her and is glad that she has found her place at the end. If all readers come away questioning who they want to be in this world and having a keener awareness of their self-identity, as I certainly have, Miller will have triumphed.</em></p>

          <p><em>I can't say how accurately the original mythology of Circe was retold, only that the telling was powerful, gripping and fun. The book follows the goddess Circe from her birth and through her whole life, with lots of mini stories of her interactions with Greek heros and other gods throughout the aeons.</p><p> I was pleasantly surprised by the feminist perspective that the author gives Circe, which is circled back to multiple times throughout the story.  If you like Greek mythology and/or want an easy read I can highly recommend!<br></em></p>

          <p><em>Circe....it hooked me in! I wanted to keep reading to find out what happened next.</p>
            <p>I felt for Circe as she had such a bad start in life at home being the most insignificant member of her family and therefore an outcast. She was unloved by all and very isolated and sought comfort from her brother and Glaucus who depended on her. She never got over the transformation of Scylla.</p>
            <p>As a reader, the traumas she went through for no reason of her own affected me. I felt for her the whole way through. It was a fascinating tale and highlighted the many imperfections of the gods. It is very relevant to the modern day and the same challenges that Circe faced are still being faced today.<br>8/10</em></p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>I’m glad I joined Lucy Reads as I would not have chosen this book myself. It revealed a world of mythology and magic. The text is intricately written with intensely evocative and descriptive writing depicting the imaginary world of gods, nymphs, mortals and monsters. Love and revenge, beauty and gore are richly portrayed in this adult ‘fairytale’.</p>
      <p>The story is told by the protagonist , a sorceress called Circe. It depicts her life and travels, events and the gods and mortals that she becomes involved with. For me personally, it was rather too descriptive and complex with so many characters connected to so many others lives that I’m afraid that I ended up skipping several chapters in order to reach the end of the tale.<br>6/10</em></p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>This was the first mythology/ fantasy book I have read and I wasn't sure how I would get on with it. Initially I found it hard to get into but as the story progressed I got pulled into it.</p><p>I loved Circe. I found that she was very hard on herself for things she had done wrong and yet was so wronged by those who should have loved and protected her. She has so many amazing qualities such as being faithful, protective, loving, hard working, resourceful, selfless and so many more. I would definitely want to her on my side in a fight!</p><p>Once you get past the era and the characters you realise that this story has so many elements that we see in current day life such as power, wealth, love and jealousy. There is also the element of Circe being excluded for being different which is a very current theme. I didn't see the ending coming but I loved it. My advice would be to give it a go as it is worth it.</p><p>Thanks for introducing me to a different genre!<br>8/10</em></p></div>
