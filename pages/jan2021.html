          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>Everyone in Shaker Heights was talking about it that summer: how Isabelle, the last of the Richardson children, had finally gone around the bend and burned the house down.</p>
          <p>In Shaker Heights, a placid, progressive suburb of Cleveland, everything is meticulously planned - from the layout of the winding roads, to the colours of the houses, to the successful lives its residents will go on to lead. And no one embodies this spirit more than Elena Richardson, whose guiding principal is playing by the rules.</p>
          <p>Enter Mia Warren - an enigmatic artist and single mother- who arrives in this idyllic bubble with her teenage daughter Pearl, and rents a house from the Richardsons.</p>
          <p>Soon Mia and Pearl become more than just tenants: all four Richardson children are drawn to the mother-daughter pair. But Mia carries with her a mysterious past, and a disregard for the rules that threatens to upend this carefully ordered community.</p>
          <p>When old family friends attempt to adopt a Chinese-American baby, a custody battle erupts that dramatically divides the town - and puts Mia and Elena on opposing sides. Suspicious of Mia and her motives, Elena is determined to uncover the secrets in Mia's past. But her obsession will come at an unexpected and devastating cost...</p>

             <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
             <p><em>I really enjoyed this book! Little Fires Everywhere has some amazing characters and centres around Elena Richardson, a woman who is organised to the extreme but whose priorities are often superficial. I found Elena to be a fascinating character who both draws the reader in and also pushes them away at the same time. There are many ways in which she is impressive; she is a working mother with four teenage children, a lawyer-husband and the most ginormous house. However, she puts immense pressure on herself and her family to live up to her idealistic expectations, which leads to her children looking for support elsewhere. I felt great sadness that Lexie felt unable to talk to her mother about the abortion and that Elena’s disapproval of Izzy’s individuality led to her feeling increasingly isolated and eventually running away from home. At the very end of the book, we hear that Elena will never give up looking for Izzy and I can’t help but feel sorry for the woman who has tried to do everything right and yet gets things so wrong.</p>
               <p>Elena is contrasted in the book with Mia, a woman who does not appear to let herself be governed by rules and expectations and who is a free spirit with a secret to hide. I think a part of Elena is jealous and this leads to her destructive attempts to discredit Mia, all supposedly in the name of the trial. The questions raised about motherhood by May Ling/Mirabelle’s trial see Mia and Elena pitted against each other. Elena believes that the McCulloughs can provide the baby with a comfortable home where she will want for little, just like she has provided for her children. On the other hand, Mia believes that a birth mother should not be required to give up her own child and that the love of a mother trumps everything else. Even though the McCulloughs win the trial, I couldn’t help but feel that the message Celeste Ng is portraying is opposite to this. May Ling does actually return to her birth mother, and it is notable that all four of Elena’s children find solace in the house on Winslow Road and in Mia’s presence when they can’t find it at home. The romantic in me wants to conclude that love, attention and acceptance win out over reputation, appearances and luxury. Perhaps, with their large house burnt down, Elena Richardsons will discover this too, and resolve her relationship with her other three children.</p>
               <p>This was an excellent read and I would highly recommend it. As well as creating intriguing characters and raising important issues, Celeste Ng has a great writing style and is very quotable! I will definitely be picking up another of her books in the future.</em></p>

             <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
             <p><em>I loved this book as it tells a story within the timeframe of Mia and her daughter Pearl  arriving in a neighbourhood called Shaker Heights and follows their lives until the minute they leave. The impact and connections they make during their short time in this community is what the story is all about. Mia, Pearl and a family with 4 teenage children called the Richardsons become closely entwined and as a result, love, friendship, anxiety, kindness and teenage angst are all described in a credible and compelling way. Also, there are  underlying, deeply hidden secrets which are unravelled with dramatic consequences for all. It is a modern day novel and I’m looking forward to watching the tv series next.</p></em>
