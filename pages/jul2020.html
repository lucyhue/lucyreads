          <h3><b>SYNOPSES</b></h3>
          <p><b>Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</b></p>
          <p>As teenagers in Lagos, Ifemelu and Obinze fall in love. Their Nigeria is under military dictatorship, and people are fleeing the country if they can. The self-assured Ifemelu departs for America. There she suffers defeats and triumphs, finds and loses relationships, all the while feeling the weight of something she never thought of back home: race. Obinze had hoped to join her, but post-9/11 America will not let him in, and he plunges into a dangerous, undocumented life in London.</p>
          <p>Thirteen years later, Obinze is a wealthy man in a newly democratic Nigeria, while Ifemelu has achieved success as a blogger. But after so long apart and so many changes, will they find the courage to meet again, face to face? </p>
          <p><b>On Beauty by Zadie Smith</b></p>
          <p>Set in New England mainly and London partly, On Beauty concerns a pair of feuding families - the Belseys and the Kipps - and a clutch of doomed affairs. It puts low morals among high ideals and asks some searching questions about what life does to love. </p>
          <p> For the Belseys and the Kipps, the confusions - both personal and political - of our uncertain age are about to be brought close to home: right to the heart of family. </p>
          <p><b>Queenie by Candice Carty-Williams</b></p>
          <p> Caught between the Jamaican British family who don’t seem to understand her, a job that’s not all it promised and a man she just can’t get over, Queenie’s life seems to be steadily spiralling out of control. Desperately trying to navigate her way through a hot mess of shifting cultures and toxic relationships and emerge with a shred of dignity, her missteps and misadventures will provoke howls of laughter and tears of pity – frequently on the same page. </p>
          <p><b>Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates</b></p>
          <p>An attempt to answer questions about race in America, in the form of a letter to the author's 14-year-old son.</p>
          <p>Coates takes readers along on his journey through America's history of race and its contemporary resonances through a series of awakenings - moments when he discovered some new truth about our long, tangled history of race, whether through his myth-busting professors at Howard University, a trip to a Civil War battlefield, a journey to Chicago's South Side to visit aging survivors of 20th century America's "long war on black people," or a visit with the mother of a beloved friend who was shot down by the police. </p>
          <p><b>Girl, Woman, Other by Bernadine Evaristo</b></p>
          <p> Girl, Woman, Other follows the lives and struggles of twelve very different characters. Mostly women, black and British, they tell the stories of their families, friends and lovers, across the country and through the years. </p>
          <p> Joyfully polyphonic and vibrantly contemporary, this is a gloriously new kind of history, a novel of our times: celebratory, ever-dynamic and utterly irresistible. </p>
          <p><b>Stay with Me by Ayobami Adebayo</b></p>
          <p> Yejide is hoping for a miracle, for a child. </p>
          <p> It is all her husband wants, all her mother-in-law wants, and she has tried everything - arduous pilgrimages, medical consultations, dances with prophets, appeals to God. But when her in-laws insist upon a new wife, it is too much for Yejide to bear. It will lead to jealousy, betrayal and despair. </p>
          <p><b>The Underground Railroad by Colson Whitehead</b></p>
          <p> Cora is a slave on a cotton plantation in Georgia. All the slaves lead a hellish existence, but Cora has it worse than most; she is an outcast even among her fellow Africans and she is approaching womanhood, where it is clear even greater pain awaits. When Caesar, a slave recently arrived from Virginia, tells her about the Underground Railroad, they take the perilous decision to escape to the North. </p>
          <p><b>Homegoing by Yaa Gyasi</b></p>
          <p> Effia and Esi: two sisters with two very different destinies. One sold into slavery; one a slave trader's wife. </p>
          <p> The consequences of their fate reverberate through the generations that follow. As each chapter offers up a new descendant, alternating between Effia’s and Esi’s bloodline right up to the present day, a chasm of experience and the differing legacies of chance are brought starkly to light.</p>

              <h3><b>WHY READ THESE BOOKS?</b></h3>
              <p>Books give us the opportunity to step into someone else’s shoes and see the world from their angle. With increased empathy comes an increased responsibility to ensure we are acting fairly and justly, and to ensure that race has no bearing on how we treat people.</p>
              <p>I know that in order to become race blind, we need to be race aware, which is why in July, Lucy Reads will host a free-choice month dedicated to black authors and the BLM movement with eight incredible titles to choose from. No matter which one/ones you pick, we'd love to read your review.</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><b>Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</b></p>
              <p><em>For me, Americanah’s key strength is in its portrayal of Ifemelu’s experiences in America and her struggle to understand how she is treated. I didn’t find the character of Obinze as convincing or interesting, and wasn’t that engaged by the underlying plot of the couple being separated then reunited. But I loved reading about the character of Ifemelu and it was her sections of the book that opened my eyes to matters of race I’d never thought about before. Ifemelu says that she didn’t even realise she was black before she went to America, which perfectly summarises the issues explored by Adichie in Americanah.</p>
              <p>I found the different attitudes shown by the characters both fascinating and appalling, and the ones that struck me most were those who didn’t seem racist on the surface, such as Kimberly, Ifemelu’s babysitting employer, and her sister Laura. Both are keen to show that they aren’t racist in any way. However, there were many issues with their attitudes towards race which must be unconsciously shared by many. The expectation they have about Africa being a simple, uncivilised place where all vegetables must be organic as the society isn’t advanced enough to have mass-produced them, is one example of their underlying condescension towards black people. The characters are keen to state that they are helping Africans out as much as they can through their charitable donations, epitomising the “white saviour” trope and, although they speak with good intentions, they betray their ignorance of the countries they are “helping”. There must be so many people like Kimberly and Laura who don’t see themselves as racist but act in ways that continue to reinforce racist stereotypes.</p>
              <p>On other occasions, Ifemelu is told that her name is “beautiful”, which seems to be used as a synonym for “different” or “foreign”. When she meets new people, conversation turns their holidays in Africa and they chat as if safaris are part of every day life for anyone African. Ifemelu is often subjected to racial bias, whether that be in her struggle to get a job interview or her refusal to be seen at the hairdressers until her white boyfriend intervenes. While reading, I found myself questioning my own attitudes towards race, mortified in case I have ever displayed behaviour that mirrored Ifemelu’s experiences in Americanah. In terms of raising awareness, educating and encouraging her readers to be critical of their own attitudes towards race, I think Adichie has been very successful and I would highly recommend this book.</em></p>

          <p><b>Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</b></p>
          <p><em>I have to admit that I struggled to keep going with this book. I stopped at one point in order to research the Nigerian history that Ifemelu grew up with, as I was struggling to find any link to her. Whilst I enjoyed the research, it didn't help me to find an emotional link to Ifemelu's character. As I got further into the book I got more drawn in to the experiences of racism that she, Obinze and others experience, but again, I didn't have the same kind of emotional response as I did to A Woman Is No Man last month, despite the context being just as unfamiliar to my own experiences. In many ways, the cultural constraints seemed similar - there is an expectation on Ifemelu and Obinze to study abroad, love the West and remain Nigerian - but perhaps because of Ifemelu's cynical disdain for herself, and the corrupt posturing of the Nigeria she returns to (especially the Nigerpolitan club) I also found it hard to care.</p>

      <p><b>Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates</b></p>
      <p><em>This book is a letter from a black father to his teenage son. It talks about the history of black Americans, the father’s experience growing up, headline events and how he hopes his son can deal with prejudice. It wasn’t an easy read for me as I like chapters and at points this book felt like long periods of ranting. I understand the point of the book, it shouldn’t need to be a thing to be written about, but I felt that I could never fully understand as a white woman.  What black Americans go through is so far removed from how I grew to understand the world. Innocent people feeling fear in such a powerful country, where you would assume people of all races can just exist side by side. America needs to sort this out!!</p>

        <p><b>Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates</b></p>
        <p><em>Between the World and Me is an incredibly powerful read, made even more poignant due to the fact that it takes the form of a letter which Coates writes to his teenage son. Throughout the letter, Coates interweaves history with stories from his own past and journalism as well as direct addresses to his son which all culminate in a heartbreaking, challenging and unforgettable narrative. Ultimately, this book is a letter that no parent should have to write but one that everyone must read.</p></em>

      <p><b>Stay with Me by Ayobami Adebayo </b></p>
      <p><em>This book is a very easy and quick read.  I have never considered what life is like in Nigeria and it certainly opened my eyes.  It’s not a book about racism, it’s about the regime they must live under and the expectations of a woman.  Interesting that it’s never considered that the man might not be able to get his wife pregnant, only that there must be something wrong with the wife, she is useless.  I loved the ending, like putting a plaster on years of heartbreak.  I would recommend this book.</p>

      <p><b>On Beauty by Zadie Smith</b></p>
      <p><em>I was intrigued by the blurb for this book so thought I would give it a go! I haven't read any books by Zadie Smith before but I will certainly be exploring her other books now. On Beauty is an incredibly powerful story which gripped me from start to finish (it is quite a long book!). The story is at once personal yet universal and paints a vivid picture of family life. Highly recommended! <p>
