          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>A gripping and compassionate drama of two families linked by chance, love and tragedy.</p>
          <p>Gillam, upstate New York: a town of ordinary, big-lawned suburban houses. The Gleesons have recently moved there and soon welcome the Stanhopes as their new neighbours.</p>
          <p>Lonely Lena Gleeson wants a friend but Anne Stanhope - cold, elegant, unstable - wants to be left alone.</p>
          <p>It's left to their children - Lena's youngest, Kate, and Anne's only child, Peter - to find their way to one another. To form a friendship whose resilience and love will be almost broken by the fault line dividing both families, and by the terrible tragedy that will engulf them all.</p>
          <p>A tragedy whose true origins only become clear many years later . . .</p>
          <p>A story of love and redemption, faith and forgiveness, Ask Again, Yes reveals the way childhood memories change when viewed from the distance of adulthood - villains lose their menace, and those who appeared innocent seem less so. </p>
          <p>A story of how, if we're lucky, the violence lurking beneath everyday life can be vanquished by the power of love. </p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>This book has tragedy at its centre - the shooting of Francis Gleason by next door neighbour, Anne Stanhope, is something that shakes both families immeasurably and leads to rifts that you would think unhealable. And yet both before and after the incident, their children, Kate and Peter, are drawn to each other, connected by their childhood love and the bond of having gone through the same tragedy, albeit on different sides. </p>
                <p>The chapters often flick between the Gleesons and the Stanhopes, and because we get to know both families, I found myself swinging between them like a pendulum, unable to decide where my loyalty lay. As the book draws towards its conclusion, Mary Beth Keane shows us that the impacts of our actions aren’t simply limited to the time and place when they are committed, but that they are felt through the generations. You can’t help but feel that Peter’s alcoholism is not the the product of a single factor: it could be due to his father leaving him, which may in turn be due to his own father’s alcoholism before that; it could be due to his mother’s poor mental health, which again could be due to her own mother’s suicide; and it could of course be triggered by the shooting incident itself and the longer term complications of living with the knowledge that your own mother shot your wife’s father. These are complex characters with complex lives, which make for a truly compelling read. </p>
                <p>The novel ends on an optimistic note, regardless of its tragic contents. Despite everything that has happened in their lives, Peter and Kate’s relationship is strong and Kate reveals that if she had known everything that they would go through, she would still have said "yes" to Peter’s proposal. At the close, the obvious wronged party in the whole book, Francis Gleeson, displays incredible forgiveness as he surveys his family, including the child of the woman who shot him, and considers his good fortune. Certainly this is a lesson in generosity of spirit for all of us. </p>
                <p>I really enjoyed this book and couldn’t put it down! Read it if you get the chance!</em></p>

          <p><em>I absolutely loved this brilliantly written book! Essentially it is a love story set in current times. I was gripped from the first few pages and found it incredibly compelling! It is a very moving story about the power of love, hope and forgiveness. It also shows how healing can slowly take place even after tragic events have had life changing consequences.</p>
            <p>I felt very connected to the families in this story because of the incredible detail and emotion portrayed about them by the author. I couldn’t stop thinking about this book and I will definitely order another by Mary Beth Keane.</em></p>

        <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
        <p><em>This is a slow burn read.  I was waiting for more action, but the book was more about the fallout following a single event.  I really felt for Peter and I thought Kate was incredibly strong.  She had to stick to her guns and fight to get the man she wanted and then fight to keep him.  I enjoyed reading about their marriage and how it’s not all hearts and flowers. </p>
          <p> I did think a secret about the night of the shooting was going to be revealed towards the end of the book, but there wasn’t any big reveal.  Overall, a pleasant read that bumbled along and kept me interested.</em></p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>Ask Again, Yes is a novel about forgiveness and love, blame and regret with a tinge of sadness all the way through. It has a breadth to it in both characters and time but much of the story happens off the pages and the time scale is fast.</p>
      <p> I didn’t like the title of the book and trying to work out its relevance was distracting, but at the end of every chapter I found myself starting the next one. All in all a good read and one that will stay with you for quite a while.</p>
