          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>“Tara Westover and her family grew up preparing for the End of Days but, according to the government, she didn’t exist. She hadn’t been registered for a birth certificate. She had no school records because she’d never set foot in a classroom, and no medical records because her father didn’t believe in hospitals.
            <br><br>
            As she grew older, her father became more radical and her brother more violent. At sixteen, Tara knew she had to leave home. In doing so she discovered both the transformative power of education, and the price she had to pay for it.”</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
              <p>This was on one of Obama's book lists in 2019, and was recommended to me by a friend. It is a true story, written by Tara Westover about her own experiences. It is incredible to think of the changes she made in her life, from never attending school to being awarded a PhD from Cambridge. I'm expecting to be shocked and inspired by her story.</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>Education both makes Tara who she is and alienates her from everything she has ever known. It is easy to look at the title of the book, hear how she escaped from a controlling Mormon family and ended up gaining a PhD from Cambridge and imagine some happy ending where getting a good education is the thing that saves her. However, as the book unfolds, it is clear that things aren’t that simple. Her family cannot accept the new Tara nor do they acknowledge her views, eventually leading to estrangement. Regardless of how extreme their views or abusive their actions, Tara finds it hard to let go of her family and spends a large portion of her adult life seeking their approval, gripped by an irrational yet completely understandable desire to retain her relationship with them. For me, the gradual alienation of her family as she becomes more educated is one of the most poignant aspects of the book - she may have gained the freedom to form her own views but she lost important figures in the process so any sense of achievement at the end of the book is bittersweet.</p>
              <p>For a long time, Tara made excuses for her family, justifying their actions and sometimes even misremembering events so as not to face the truth of what they were doing. To be critical of one’s family is perhaps the hardest thing, and the danger of accepting her family’s ways unquestioningly was brought out in the book. The damage that the family did to Tara and the impact the events of her childhood had on her mental health are evident throughout. The more times she is told that she is wrong, the more she believes it, and I was particularly saddened in the part where Tara constantly tries to convince herself that she had remembered events wrongly, putting her intellect and its reliability into question. I believe that education is an important factor in social change, and it is clear that it is her intellect that enables Tara to escape from Buck’s Peak and take control of her life. When this is called into question and suggested to be unreliable, then it seemed that the family’s hold on Tara would continue. By this point, the “character” of Tara was such that I felt that I understood who she was and how she might think, and it is a triumph on her part that I genuinely felt concern for her at this point.</p>
              <p>I found this book to be simultaneously gripping and troubling. Tara’s reflective tone is not nostalgic and the text isn’t full of explicit life lessons or expectations of pity. She doesn’t even present the actions of her father and brother, which already elicit a strong response from the reader, as shockingly as she could. Her aim is not to expose her family and their ways and have the reader admire her for her courage and her journey. She writes with honesty and gives the reader a clear vision of her life on the mountain that somehow makes sense of her actions throughout the book. To say I enjoyed the book seems to disrespect its contents, but I certainly felt engaged and challenged by it. I have thought about it a lot over the past month and am glad to have chosen it as the first read of the year.</em></p>

          <p><em>At times I could hardly bear to read on as the isolated, grim and abusive life that Tara endured as she was growing up was harrowingly described. Her later unfolding insights into the reasons why her parents behaved as they did were intelligently revealed  and the conflicts that she felt were bravely rationalised with the incredibly moving result of forging a separate and new life for herself. I was moved to tears at the end as I thought back to the terrible struggle she had endured and also the hope for a better future.</em></p>

Tara is an amazing storyteller and she takes you on a complex and heartfelt journey giving some insight into her unique childhood and her journey to becoming educated.

      <p><em>Crikey! I always avoid the ‘J Word cliche’ but this has definitely taken me on one heck of a journey.
        So much to say... the first revelation being that I truly assumed at the beginning of the book that I was reading something set so much longer ago than it actually was!</p>
        <p>I was hooked from beginning to end. Such powerful themes in the reflections of an adult through the eyes of the child she was.. were agonising, poignant and beggared belief??
        A painfully vivid picture of the long term devastating impact that mental illness, isolation and extremism can have on every aspect of family life. So honestly and non-judgementally related.
        I wanted to rush in to rescue Tara, find decent help for Shawn and offer stammering therapy to Tyler..!!
        <p>An unforgettable read. Indeed - an education!!<br>10/10</em></p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>Through reading this book I realised how little my own fundamental beliefs about life have ever been challenged, and am drawn to consider what my reaction might be to challenging an upbringing that taught me that my thoughts and existence were wrong.</p>
        <p>Tara Westover's struggle to reconcile her desire for knowledge and truth with her love for her family and her understanding of how to be a good member within it is compellingly brutal as she battles duty with integrity, gaslighting with self-belief. Tales of horrific accidents befalling her brothers and father, and the violence she herself suffers are difficult to read, but I found the most challenging parts those where her increasingly varied experiences away from the mountain force her to confront her life there through the eyes of the world outside.</p>
        <p>Her desire to love and be loved is palpable throughout, as is the pain when her mother and sister in particular turn their backs on her. Her fear of losing them is matched by their fear of a woman they no longer understand and whose knowledge of the modern world threatens their entire way of life. There is a primal struggle which has no obvious or right answer: whichever path Tara took risked loss and distress to herself and those she loves, and the real triumph is that she maintains her identity and sense of self throughout.<br>9/10</em></p>

      <p><em>It's a story of indoctrination.  To some extent this happens to us all - we follow the beliefs and values instilled in us by our families. If it's all you've ever known, it must be true. It is only when you have another world for comparison that you begin to see that perhaps there are alternatives.</p>
        <p>This is the story of a backwoods family, ruled by religious beliefs, sometimes taken to extremes, especially by Tara's father. His views on education outside the home, hospitals, doctors - authority figures; mostly based on fear of the unknown - he trusts no-one and his views are the only viable ones.</p>
        <p>Tara does break free by taking the path of academia so abhorred by her father - and yet his influence has left her with nagging doubts about her choices.</p>
        <p>Some of the conflicts in the Westover family were really hard to stomach - the denial of Shawn's violence difficult to believe - but symptomatic of the family's desire to close ranks.</p>
        <p>Yet, Tara not only survived, but triumphed - but at what cost??</em></p>
