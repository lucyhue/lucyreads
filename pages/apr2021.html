          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>It's 2001, the evening of sixteen-year-old Melody's coming of age ceremony in her grandparents' Brooklyn brownstone. Watched lovingly by her relatives and friends, making her entrance to the music of Prince, she wears a special custom-made dress. But the event is not without poignancy. Sixteen years earlier, that very dress was measured and sewn for a different wearer, Melody's mother, for her own ceremony - a celebration that ultimately never took place.</p>
          <p>Unfurling the history of Melody's parents and grandparents to show how they all arrived at this moment, Woodson considers not just their ambitions and successes but also the costs, the tolls they've paid for striving to overcome expectations and escape the pull of history.</p>
          <p>As it explores sexual desire and identity, ambition, gentrification, education, class and status, and the life-altering facts of parenthood, Red at the Bone most strikingly looks at the ways in which young people must so often make long-lasting decisions about their lives - even before they have begun to figure out who they are and what they want to be.</p>

          <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
            <p>I spotted this book last year when it came out in hardback and thought that the idea of history repeating itself (or not!) was so interesting. I want to find out what happened to Melody's mum and figure out the relationship with the grandparents. Intriguing!</p>

             <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
               <p><em>I like a book that I can get into. One where I can get to know the characters and empathise with them. One that gradually reveals an interesting plot and ties up all loose ends. Red at the Bone unfortunately wasn’t for me. I found it too short to get into. At 196 pages long (and those pages only having about half the number of words on them as a normal novel), this was a super-quick book to read, but one that I personally feel would have benefitted from a little more space to fully dig into the different characters’ perspectives. It was over before I was ready, and still had lots of questions unanswered.  </p>
                 <p>That’s not to say that I didn’t enjoy reading it - I read it over the Easter weekend and it was so easy to just keep turning the pages. I found Melody’s relationship with her mother, Iris, intriguing and wanted to hear more about them and see them get closer. Maybe what I wanted was too saccharin and not what Jacqueline Woodson was trying to say. Iris is a mother who did not want to be a mother - not really. Her story is one that is often told with pity or prejudice, as a teenager has a child and then leaves it behind as she goes on to pursue what she’d always intended to do, without letting the child get in the way. In some senses, this is admirable, and I appreciate how Woodson presents Iris without judgement. Nevertheless, I also felt that Iris couldn’t erase Melody’s existence, and found the lack of bond between mother and daughter sad. At the end, Iris sees something of herself in Melody, so maybe this would be something to bring them together...?</p>
                 <p>The book is told from the perspectives of all Melody’s family members. I wasn’t expecting Aubrey, Melody’s father, to be a presence in the book as he isn’t mentioned on the blurb and my expectation (rightly or wrongly) was that Iris would be a single parent. I found Aubrey a beautiful character and loved his bond with his daughter, as he protected her and worked hard for her, even within a family that wasn’t totally his own. Melody’s grandparents, Sabe and Po’Boy were wise, protective and, at times, comical. Their acceptance of Iris’ pregnancy, their willingness to uproot their whole lives to protect the family from the cruel words of others and their total love of Melody were endearing. I just wanted to hear more stories about their experiences and time with their family. </p>
                 <p>Overall, an interesting and speedy read, but one that’s left me wanting more. </em></p>
