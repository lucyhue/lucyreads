          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>Athens, 1941. Nazi forces occupy Greece ... and a nation falls apart. Victoria Hislop's new Sunday Times Number One bestseller takes you into the darker days of Greek history and, through the eyes of its extraordinary heroine, illuminates the courage it takes to live in peace.</p>
          <p>After decades of political uncertainty, Greece is polarised between Right- and Left-wing views when the Germans invade. Fifteen-year-old Themis comes from a family divided by these political differences. The Nazi occupation deepens the fault-lines between those she loves just as it reduces Greece to destitution. She watches friends die in the ensuing famine and is moved to commit acts of resistance.</p>
          <p>Eventually imprisoned on the infamous islands of exile, Makronisos and then Trikeri, Themis encounters another prisoner whose life will entwine with her own in ways neither can foresee. And finds she must weigh her principles against her desire to escape and live.</p>
          <p>As she looks back on her life, Themis realises how tightly the personal and political can become entangled. While some wounds heal, others deepen.</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
              <p>I love a strong female protagonist! Themis sounds like an incredible character, who fights for what she believes in and never loses sight of her goal of peace. I've also never considered what life was like in Greece during the Second World War, so can only imagine the devastating effects of the war on this beautiful country.</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>This is a great book for those long, chilly autumn evenings - I have certainly enjoyed snuggling up with my copy of Those Who Are Loved and a cuppa this October! This is a book that takes you back in time to experience the troubles of Nazi-invaded Greece, the political turmoil it causes and the the lasting effects on generations to come. We see the story through the eyes of Themis over almost 90 years and get to know a family over five generations, but each character is constructed in such a way that we feel we know them completely. Family is at the heart of this book, and the difficult balance of family and politics comes back time and time again.</p>
                <p>There are so many bits that have stayed with me and I want to mention in this review. The wedge driven between her siblings by their opposing political views marks the beginning of this book. The death of Themis’ closest friend, Fotini, due to the lack of resources during the occupation is the catalyst for her political activity. She escapes from Athens and fights for what she believes in, and it is fascinating to hear of her experiences at this time, bearing in mind the old lady we are introduced to in the prologue. We feel great sympathy when Themis decides to sign the agreement that states her regret at being part of the communist army in order to save her son, the great weight of this decision and the pain it causes her. We feel her later disappointment when her son, born during her imprisonment on Trikeri and thus a child of the communist army, later abandons his Greek heritage in favour of the bright lights and money-making opportunities of America, showing no interest in the political upheaval of his home country. And finally, we appreciate the full-circle nature of things at the end of the novel, when his son and Themis’ grandson, Nikos, is said to be a lecturer in political economy, and seems as dedicated towards fairness and equality as his namesake uncle. As well as realigning Angelos with his family, the inclusion of the younger Nikos shows that the fight that Themis experienced in her youth has passed down the generations, and we feel satisfied that goodness will prevail in the end.</p>
                <p>What a book! I hope you enjoyed it as much as I did. It took me a little while to get into, as Victoria Hislop weaves in a great amount of political history as the backdrop for her story, which can be quite dense! However, this only serves to create a rich context for events to unfold against and gives the reader a deeper understanding of the characters’ choices. A great October read and one that will stay with me for a long time.</em></p>

          <p><em>I absolutely loved this book. One of the best I have ever read. I knew nothing of the history of Greece that was so well explained during the story. I really enjoyed learning through reading a fictional story. Some parts of the book were heartbreaking. The loss of Nikos had me in tears. The fact that it was such a family orientated book was also lovely to read, allowing you to feel something for each character and the bonds. I will read some more by this author. </p>

        <p><em>I have never read such an emotional book. It was amazing to experience all aspects of human life rendered so movingly on the page. The characters were skilfully drawn and their historical moment had clear resonances with today’s culture. However, it was quite a long book and I found the historical content quite heavy. Five stars - would recommend! </p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>I'm a fan of Victoria Hislop anyway and was half-way through this book when it was announced as October's book. (If anyone wants to try another VH, The Island is also excellent). I loved this book as much as the others: it was so full of emotion and strength in the face of heartbreaking divisions playing out in the family flat and on the world stage. I didn't know much about the history of Greece in the period after the war, and had previously under-appreciated the awful consequences of the famine that killed Fotini before reading this. Against all the political turmoil I loved how Greek the whole thing felt through the little details: the ubiquity of churches, the descriptions of the old ladies' clothes, the smoking, the olive groves and the mountains. Ultimately, it felt like being in Greece again.</p>
