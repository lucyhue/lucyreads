          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>"For years, rumors of the "Marsh Girl" have haunted Barkley Cove, a quiet town on the North Carolina coast. So in late 1969, when handsome Chase Andrews is found dead, the locals immediately suspect Kya Clark, the so-called Marsh Girl. But Kya is not what they say.</p>
          <p>Sensitive and intelligent, she has survived for years alone in the marsh that she calls home, finding friends in the gulls and lessons in the sand. Then the time comes when she yearns to be touched and loved. When two young men from town become intrigued by her wild beauty, Kya opens herself to a new life - until the unthinkable happens."</p>
          <p>Where the Crawdads Sing is at once an exquisite ode to the natural world, a heartbreaking coming-of-age story, and a surprising tale of possible murder. Owens reminds us that we are forever shaped by the children we once were, and that we are all subject to the beautiful and violent secrets that nature keeps.</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
              <p>This is a book I spotted in the bookshop and was intrigued, partly because I hadn't a clue what crawdads were and partly because I love a mystery to solve! It looks like we are all going to be spending more time indoors in the coming month, so what better time to read a challenging book like <em>Where the Crawdads Sing</em>?</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>I devoured this book, which is always a sign that it’s a good one!</p>
                <p>Kya is a young girl, abandoned by her family, who takes solace in the marsh that is her home. It is easy to understand why she so quickly latches on to anyone who expresses an interest in her, despite their intentions, in a desperate hope for love and acceptance. And it is even easier to understand why, having been left behind so many times, she develops a self-reliance coupled with a lack of trust for others, that will both look after her and keep her from developing meaningful relationships.</p>
                <p>I was saddened but maybe not surprised at how most of the white people in the book respond to Kya. The town people reject her for being different, warn their children not to go near her, make up stories about her and blame her for Chase’s death, an easy scapegoat, fuelled by their existing prejudices. This pack mentality, where it is easiest to pick on the “other”, the outsider, is something Owens makes us disapprove of in the book, only to make us question this in the final pages. By the end, I felt that, despite rooting for her the whole way through the book, I had also underestimated her and maybe was as guilty as the other people in the book of not expecting her capable of much.</p>
                <p>I’m not going to lie - I had to look up Crawdads on Google - but I now feel that I have a proper appreciation of the beauty of the marsh and a renewed outlook on the natural world. The descriptions are beautiful and so intwined into the narrative that they feel an integral part of the story and not the backdrop it is set against. Some books enable you to create a vision in your head, and this is definitely one of those.</p>
                <p>Owens cleverly writes the book in two time frames; the “present day” of the murder investigation, and the childhood of Kya. As we hear more of Kya’s childhood, the two come together without you even noticing. I felt engaged by both periods, and when they aligned, the impetus to turn the page and find out what was going to happen was strong. I loved his book and would recommend it to anyone.</em></p>

          <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
          <<p><em>This isn’t a book I would ever have chosen myself (mainly due to the cover!), so I was very pleased to have it recommended through ‘Lucy Reads’. I enjoyed this book and would recommend to anyone looking for something a bit different: this is a book that cannot be easily categorised into a particular genre.</p>
            <p>Delia Owens paints an atmospheric picture of the marsh and the world Kya inhabits is realised with vivid detail.  The novel moves through different perspectives and time periods, as Kya’s journey to adulthood overlaps with the ongoing murder investigation. This structure makes this an engaging and unusual read which works through suggestion and metaphor, with much left for the reader to piece together.</p>
            <p>Only in the very final pages of the book is the true nature of the story revealed to the reader and only here did I feel totally gripped by the novel. Some of the earlier sections were a little slow-going and it was hard to work out where things were heading or how everything fitted together. I would quite like to read it again now I know the final outcome as I think I might enjoy it more!</p>
            <p>Overall, an engaging read for the lockdown and I am interested to see that a film may be in development too.</p>

          <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
          <p><em>I loved this book and finished it in just a few days. Like in Educated and Circe, we discover a main female character who is either mistreated or abandoned by those who should be loving and protecting her. Like these heroines before her she shows huge resilence and resoucefulness to not only survive but also make something of her life against all the odds. Along the way she has to come to terms with the predjudice that exists within her community who perceive her as different and also she has to learn who she can trust.</p>
          <p>This story has so many different threads which include beautiful descriptions of the marsh and its flora and fauna, a love story, friendships and a mystery. I found that I just couldn't put it down as I was rooting for Kya and needed to know what happened to her. I shall be adding Jumpin and Mabel to my list of characters I want on my side when the going gets tough!</p>
          <p>If you like this book I would also recommend "Before we were yours" by Lisa Wingate</p>

      <p><em>Where the Crawdads Sing by Delia Owens was certainly a mesmerising read! Right from the beginning you are transported into the unfamiliar world of the marsh with wonderful imagery and artistic description of the flora and fauna of the North Carolina coastal area.</p>
      <p>Interwoven with this is the story of Kya whose loss of her mother and family present her with a profound suspicion and distrust of any other human being. Her loneliness pulls at your heartstrings and this is reiterated later during the murder trial in court.</p>
      <p>A wonderful tale on many levels that stays with you long after reading the book.</p>

        <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
        <p><em>I loved this book until the last few pages. The intertwining of the two timelines was very skilled, and observing Kya's growth from child to celebrated naturalist was beautiful. The murder timeline was excellent, but I disagreed with the resolution. It felt like an opportunity to write another A. H. poem, than a reasonable ending. The link to the mantis /fireflies was quite clever and I noticed the hints on the way, but by coming to the conclusion it did, the narrative then failed to explain how it was possible (when the trial was very clear that it wasn't), or how it was in character for the murderer to have done it. The calculation, manipulation and familiarity with an alien world just didn't ring true to me. I also felt that the choice of murderer then undid a lot of the work about prejudice and abandonment that had been explored so well previously. A fantastic book with a disappointing ending, for me.</p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>I thought this book was absolutely wonderful! It is a very powerful story of love, loneliness and loyalty and is set in an intricately described natural setting of lagoons, marshland and sea. This is where the protagonist, Kya, is forced to survive and grow up on her own. Kya lives as one with the natural seascape but as she is perceived as 'different' by the town folk and she suffers huge prejudice as a result. This prejudice results in  life changing events throughout her life.</p>
      <p>The aching loneliness she feels leads to her constantly waiting and looking out for key people in her life who have abandoned her at one time or another. This is so movingly depicted particularly when she occasionally has chance to hold another's hand for a few fleeting moments. The lifelong love she feels for her soulmate is again gently and beautifully described throughout the story. He is a constant and  cares for Kya more than anything.</p>
      <p>Kya is portrayed as a beautiful and intelligent girl and she is able to make a successful career as an expert in flora and fauna of the marshlands.</p>
      <p>This is a gripping mystery which unfolds steadily through flashbacks in time and leads to a heart pounding finish. </p>
      <p>Incredibly written and I loved every stunning word!</p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p> The essence of the book was the fallout following Roy's conviction so it was important for this to take place early in the book. I had no particular feelings for Andre either way however I found myself really disliking Celestial. Although she explained that her marriage to Roy was not established enough to be tested by such a challenge it felt to me like she left him to his fate and just wanted to move on. I also found it incredible that she was so enraged by Roy's news about his biological father when she herself had kept a huge secret from him.</p>
      <p>I found references to ongoing racial discrimmination poignant and disturbing such as the scene about the "baby maid" and Roy's brutal arrest. I found the letter exchange part of the book tedious and felt the author was a little clumsy in her use of them to show the evolution of the couple's relationship. The author did have a knack of describing the character's feelings in a way that made them very relatable. I was happy with the ending as I felt it was the only outcome that worked for the three main characters.</p>
      <p>As a side note Big Roy was my favourite character in the book for his steadfastness and his unswerving loyalty to Roy. He and Circe are both now on my list of people I want on my side when the going gets tough! Inspite of some of the flaws of this book I would still recommend it.</p>
