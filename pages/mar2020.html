              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>The blurb of this book tells you that a young couple will be separated early in their marriage, as the husband is put in prison for a crime he didn’t commit. Therefore, there were few surprises, as the story plays out as advertised. How the events affects the couple, and those nearest to them is what makes this book so gripping. The pain they, and all those nearest to them, go through in the book makes the reader reevaluate their priorities and consider the fragility of our lives. At a time when covid-19 is spreading globally, the ease with which your everyday existence can be turned on its head seems entirely relatable, and I felt for all the characters involved as their lives were changed forever.</p>
                <p>Hearing the story from three different viewpoints enables the reader to understand how each character has come to their present state and the decisions they have made to get there. This should mean that we feel torn, as we understand each character’s motivations and perspectives. However, although the idea was promising and the subject matter moving, I felt that the style of writing, where the reader discovers everything that has happened after the event itself, and often from a different viewpoint, somehow disconnected me from the emotion in the story. I would have preferred to find out more about the characters up-front, rather than discovering about them as the book progressed, so I could build a picture of them early on and then would have more of an emotional response when events unfolded. This doesn’t detract from the important issues this book raises and the keenness with which I pressed on to the end. But for such a powerful storyline, and the three first-person narratives giving us access to their innermost thoughts, I expected to feel more invested in their outcomes.</em></p>

          <p><em>Very good book, one which I would have picked to read myself. Thank you for bringing it to my attention.</p>
            <p>It was an emotional read.  I would have liked a bit more about what it was like/what he faced in prison.  I loved Roy Snr and was cheering him when he kept Andre at his house!  When you watch programmes about wrongful convictions, you feel for the person sent to prison, but you don’t think about the effect it has on their loved ones.  Good read!</p>

          <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
          <p><em>This book centres on a miscarriage of justice and because of that, the complex lives of the three main characters are brought to life and woven together in a very honest way.</p>
          <p>I wasn’t sure about the narration being done by the characters at first but it certainly holds you to the end and keeps you guessing.</p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>For me, this book was a bit like someone describing a photograph in the sense that the fundamental plot is already largely available to you before you start reading. Of course it is unclear what will happen in the end but as it’s not an overly plot driven narrative, the interest lies in the steady unfolding of how the lives of all of those involved are messily intertwined.</p>
      <p>Although I thought it was a beautifully written book and particularly enjoyed the letter exchanges, I initially felt the same as Lucy in that if more had been given about the central characters earlier on, I too may have felt more emotionally connected to the various events that ensued.</p>
      <p>However, on reflection, perhaps the sentiment that we, as the reader, feel like we aren’t given enough time to acquaint ourselves meaningfully with the central characters before Roy is arrested, reflects the way that Roy and Celestial were not given enough time to establish deep roots in their relationship before their time together was unjustly and cruelly ripped apart. I think Celestial, at one point, even refers to the relationship as being like a sapling that didn’t have chance to root (or something along those lines!) and this is repeatedly juxtaposed by the rock solid, rooted connectedness shown by Big Roy and Olive’s relationship. Our feeling of not knowing them well enough is arguably, to an extent, the same as what Celestial feels towards Roy. Even right at the beginning their argument stems from Roy not having told her about his real father. Therefore, although I initially felt puzzled as to why I wasn’t overly moved by such a moving set of events, I now feel like my sense of emotional disconnect is not just that, instead it serves to illuminate further why their relationship could not be.</p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>I listened to this on Audible which I wouldn't recommend at all as the female lead is narrated by two different people. One of the voices is perfect for Celestial's character and the other is wrong on so many levels that it is very distracting. I did however love the story and finished it in a matter of days. Unlike some reviewers I did feel an emotional connection with Roy and I didn't mind that we didn't know his character well at the beginning and that we learnt more as the story unfolded.</p>
      <p> The essence of the book was the fallout following Roy's conviction so it was important for this to take place early in the book. I had no particular feelings for Andre either way however I found myself really disliking Celestial. Although she explained that her marriage to Roy was not established enough to be tested by such a challenge it felt to me like she left him to his fate and just wanted to move on. I also found it incredible that she was so enraged by Roy's news about his biological father when she herself had kept a huge secret from him.</p>
      <p>I found references to ongoing racial discrimmination poignant and disturbing such as the scene about the "baby maid" and Roy's brutal arrest. I found the letter exchange part of the book tedious and felt the author was a little clumsy in her use of them to show the evolution of the couple's relationship. The author did have a knack of describing the character's feelings in a way that made them very relatable. I was happy with the ending as I felt it was the only outcome that worked for the three main characters.</p>
      <p>As a side note Big Roy was my favourite character in the book for his steadfastness and his unswerving loyalty to Roy. He and Circe are both now on my list of people I want on my side when the going gets tough! Inspite of some of the flaws of this book I would still recommend it.</p>
