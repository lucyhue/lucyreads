          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>Everyone knows Daisy Jones and The Six.</p>
          <p>Their albums were on every turntable, they sold out arenas from coast to coast, their sound defined an era. And then, on 12 July 1979, they split.</p>
          <p>Nobody ever knew why. Until now.</p>
          <p>The only thing that's certain is that from the moment Daisy Jones walked, barefoot, on to the stage at the Whisky, the band were irrevocably changed...</p>
          <p>This is the story of their incredible rise and fall. The ambition, the desire, the heartbreak, and the music.</p>

              <p>I've picked this book up a few times, attracted by the cover and the fact that it's about music! Initially, I was unsure of the interview-style, but I read the first few pages and was quickly hooked. This book is a complete contrast from April's and looks to be great fun!</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>I don’t think I’ve ever read a book quite like this before. At first, I was a little put-off by the interview style, but I actually think this is one of the greatest features of the book. The book has a gossip-mag vibe, where you feel like you are being let into secrets from the band’s shady history and want to keep reading more to see what they all have to say about each dramatic episode. The interviews also allow you to fully get to know each of the individual characters, through hearing their take on a situation, and I quickly felt that I knew who they all were and what they brought to the band. I particularly enjoyed the tension, confusion and, at some points, humour created when two people remembered something differently - when Billy says Daisy was wearing a white t-shirt and then Karen reports that it was a yellow crop top made me smile as their different versions of the same memory matched the personalities of each of the characters.</p>
              <p>The fact that it is so hard to tell whether this is actually a true story or fictional (and I did google it to check!) must be one of the greatest achievements of Daisy Jones & The Six. Jenkins Reid has created a wholly believable world of rock ‘n’ roll, with true-to-life characters and a credible rise to fame. However, I do think you have to read this book in as few sittings as possible to get fully into the world she creates and remember who everyone is!</p>
              <p>I know that many people have read this book and been drawn into the rockstar lifestyle portrayed, wishing they were one of The Six! I have to say that it didn’t have that effect on me, but I was taken with the individual characters and I enjoyed following them during their rise to fame. I always prefer a plot-driven novel rather than a character-analysis, but nevertheless, I did enjoy Daisy Jones & The Six and am glad I went out of my comfort zone to read it!</em></p>

          <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
          <p><em>I really enjoyed this. Different style with it being an interview, but it was a bit like reading a diary based book. The twist towards the end - I didn’t see that coming. I want a sequel to see whether they did end up together. What a strong woman Camilla was, and Billy for resisting temptation once he was clean. I did think there was going to be more of a big secret though, like a death based plot, but it didn’t matter that there wasn’t. The writing was so good it was hard to believe it was fictional.</p>

          <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
          <p>I wouldn't have picked up this book myself, but I'm glad I read it. The subject matter of a rock and roll band didn't particularly interest me, but it was a great backdrop for exploring the relationships between the characters and their different recollections of events. It was really well written though, and the interview conversation style made it so dynamic. I had to Google it to check whether it was a true story. Karen and Camila are both such strong women, and even Daisy finds her strength and self awareness by the end. I was glad about that!</p>

        <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
        <p>It took me a while to get into this book, partly because you are immediately bombarded with many characters which you need to familiarise yourself with and also because it is written in an interview style. After a while this enables you to become involved in the story through everyone’s perspective and at the end, a surprising twist makes sense of it all.</p>
        <p>It lacked somewhat in plot but was a credible story and I must admit that I did ‘Google’ the songs written at the back of the book just in case they were real!</p>

        <p>Thoroughly enjoyed this. Again, not a book I would normally pick up so thanks so much for the recommendation Lucy. I'll definitely be reading other books by this author. I got so into it, I felt like I knew the band personally. An easy read and well worth it.</p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p>I listened to this book on Audible and I am very glad I chose that medium. The audible version gives a flow to the story that I think would have lacked in the written version. As a listener,  I found having a voice for each character gave another dimension to their personality and helped you to connect to them more.</p>
      <p>That said, I found at least the first half of the book was very slow and I found myself not really caring what happened to the characters or the band. Instead I found myself being  frustrated by their egos, their pettiness, their addictions and in some cases not taking full of advantage of their talent. In the second half of the book I did feel that it does address other issues well  such as fame, addiction, self destructive behaviours, self confidence, love and friendship, to name but a few. There is also discussion about finding a path in life which makes you happy which may not necessarily include your talent.</p>
      <p>There are some lovely quotes in the book such as one by Daisy talking about people's opinion of her talent being higher than her own opinion of it:</p>
      <p>"We all need people to hold up the right mirrors for us"</p>
      <p>There are some interesting reveals at the end of the book and we get to know what has become of the characters in the present day  which rounds the story off nicely however overall it was all "too little too late" for me. I don't regret spending time listening to this story but I wouldn't recommend it to a friend</p>
