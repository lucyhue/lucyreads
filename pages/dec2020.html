          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p><em>Where do you see yourself in five years?</p></em>
          <p>When Type-A Manhattan lawyer Dannie Kohan is asked this question at the most important interview of her career, she has a meticulously crafted answer at the ready. Later, after nailing her interview and accepting her boyfriend's marriage proposal, Dannie goes to sleep knowing she is right on track to achieve her five-year plan.</p>
          <p>But when she wakes up, she’s suddenly in a different apartment, with a different ring on her finger, and beside a very different man. The television news is on in the background, and she can just make out the scrolling date. It’s the same night—December 15—but 2025, five years in the future.</p>
          <p>After a very intense, shocking hour, Dannie wakes again, at the brink of midnight, back in 2020. She can’t shake what has happened and files it away in the back of her mind.</p>
          <p>That is, until four-and-a-half years later, when by chance Dannie meets the very same man from her long-ago vision.</p>
          <p>Brimming with joy and heartbreak, In Five Years is an unforgettable love story that reminds us of the power of loyalty, friendship, and the unpredictable nature of destiny.</p>

          <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
            <p>This book is set on the 15th December 2020 so we will be reading it at exactly the same time that the characters are experiencing it! I don't know about you, but lockdown has got me thinking about what the next few years are going to be like, so I'm hoping for an optimistic and wholesome story that fills us all with excitement for good things to come!</p>

             <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
             <p><em>This book appealed to me because it’s set in December 2020 and offers a glimpse into the future. After the year we’ve had, the chance to see what might be ahead is just what I wanted and In Five Years didn’t disappoint.</p>
               <p>The book’s previous reviews all indicate that this is a heartbreaking read and they’re not wrong. I didn’t expect the storyline about Bella’s illness and really felt the impact it had on the characters. I personally was less interested in the Bella-Aaron-Dannie love triangle and more interested in seeing how the two girls would come to terms with their feelings for Aaron/Greg and each other. The flash forward scene felt somewhat contrived and the whole setup was a bit implausible. But I didn’t mind too much - it’s like when you watch a cheesy Christmas film and don’t care if it’s unrealistic!</p>
               <p>The best thing for me about this book was reading how the different characters dealt with their situation. Despite the sadness that Bella’s illness brings, both for the character Dannie and for the reader, I think this allowed the one true love story of the book to be revealed. Never mind all the boys - the greatest love in this book is that between the two best friends. Through all the ups and downs of their lives, the strength of their friendship and the love they have for each other perseveres and helps define who they are. The character of Bella is beautifully crafted and she seems like the chilled-out, happy-go-lucky friend that everyone ought to have. She not only balances Dannie’s character but also helps her work out her priorities in life and who she really is. At the end of the book, it is almost entirely down to Bella that Dannie has moved out of her comfortable but unfulfilling relationship with David, has a new home in a place that is more open and at one with the world, and finds herself in a job that more closely aligns with her values. She has truly found herself and seems much more self-reliant which opens her up for other, more fulfilling relationships in the future.</p>
               <p>In a way, I feel that this year has taught many of us similar things. It has definitely caused us to question our priorities in life and, despite the difficulties many have faced, we have shown ourselves to be incredibly resilient and adaptable. After this year, I feel that no matter what life throws at us, we will come through stronger than ever and ready to take on the world.</em></p>

             <p><em>I loved this book!  Such a delightful easy read.  A page turner from the start for me.  Well written.  I enjoyed the relationship with her best friend, some of that was hard to read due to personal circumstances, but it was dealt with really well.  The end was a twist as it wasn’t as clear cut as you thought it was going to be.  Enjoyed working out why she didn’t plan her wedding once engaged.  Nothing about this book that I didn’t enjoy!</p></em>

           <p><em>I really enjoyed In Five Years. Obviously, it contained a great deal of sadness but overall, I found the story an uplifting one. In those five years, so much happened in Dannie's life and I think she learnt a lot about herself and how she dealt with difficult situations. A nice holiday read! Thanks to Lucy for the suggestion.</p></em>

         <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
         <p><em>This book had me in floods of tears, and I read it in a single sitting. I do feel though that you can almost ignore the flash forward/back from 2020 to 2025. It's used to set up Dannie's uncomfortable relationship with Aaron/Greg, but given how tightly she tries to hold on to her life and her relationship with Bella, the excuse of jealousy that she uses actually rings a lot more true to me. The grief that she experiences as she realises that she cannot save Bella, and the damage she causes to their relationship by trying to take control of Bella's cancer is really poignant against the backdrop of this year, as is the growth as she finds the strength to choose the life she wants rather than the convenient life that she has believed herself to be living.</p>
           <p> Two other niggles: why did she have to meet the doctor right at the end and have the stage set for a new romance there? I thought Dannie was going to get an opportunity to live her life independently and learn to flourish without Bella's whimsy or David's accommodations. Dating your dead friend's oncologist seems odd anyway, and I'm annoyed that the novel perpetuates the stereotype of "a woman must have a relationship as well as career/house/etc in order to be classed as successful in life." Secondly, I find it irksome when people in books like this are really rich. Everyone in this book had a fairly lavish lifestyle (yes, they also worked hard) and that's just not realistic for most readers. It doesn't really make the important messages any stronger than if they were 'normal' people, except perhaps pointing out that even being able to afford the best healthcare won't necessarily save your life. Against the modern healthcare crisis affecting ordinary Americans though, the wealth felt a bit jarring at times.</p></em>
