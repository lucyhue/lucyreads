          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>Jackson Brodie has relocated to a quiet seaside village in North Yorkshire, in the occasional company of his recalcitrant teenage son Nathan and ageing Labrador Dido, both at the discretion of his former partner Julia. It's a picturesque setting, but there's something darker lurking behind the scenes.</p>
          <p>Jackson's current job, gathering proof of an unfaithful husband for his suspicious wife, seems straightforward, but a chance encounter with a desperate man on a crumbling cliff leads him into a sinister network-and back into the path of someone from his past. Old secrets and new lies intersect in this breathtaking new novel, both sharply funny and achingly sad, by one of the most dazzling and surprising writers at work today.</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
                <p>A detective story set in North Yorkshire seems to be exactly what we all need right now! This book promises to be funny, intriguing and exciting and something quite different to everything we've read this year. It is the fifth Jackson Brodie novel, but there's no need to have read any of the others. I'm looking forward to reading this one and trying to solve the mystery before Mr Brodie himself!</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>I have to say that Big Sky wasn’t what I was expecting so it took me a while to get into it! Initially, I was overwhelmed by the new characters that seemed to be introduced every chapter, until I got to the point where I just thought each chapter would be about a different set of people. Despite the number of characters, I actually felt that we got to know their personalities really well, probably because so much of the book is told through dialogue. From Crystal, the WAG with a secret past, to Ronnie and Reggie, the cops who find themselves in the middle of a bigger operation than they thought, to Jackson Brodie himself, the slightly incompetent detective whose moral compass is stronger than his desire to do things “by the book”, I really enjoyed getting to know the characters in Big Sky. </p>
                <p>Set in Yorkshire, there were so many familiar place names in this book, which helped me imagine their journeys and the setting for their criminal activities. I found myself surprised at these - I was expecting more of a murder mystery and so felt shocked by the activities that were going on. I did feel that there should have been more of a warning on the cover, which called their activities “something darker lurking behind the scenes”. Considering the seriousness of what was going on, the somewhat hit and miss nature of the policing was disappointing and I found it hard to reconcile the light-hearted, almost trivial tone with the gravitas of the content.</p>
                <p>As the book went on, I found myself eager to turn the page and find out what had happened and how all the characters were related. The way Kate Atkinson wove together the different storylines was masterful and I felt satisfied that justice had been done at the end. Overall, not my favourite read this year (perhaps it helps to have read other Jackson Brodie stories before!), but something a bit different and full of interesting characters!</em></p>

          <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
          <p><em>This book is a detective story depicting the grim, seedy and ruthless underworld of modern day slavery and sex trafficking which is not a topic I’d usually choose! However, it was very readable with an ever present sense of suspicion and menace compelling you to read on! There were a complex number of characters but they were described in great detail and became believable and recognisable. As the plot thickens the noose tightens around the interlinked criminals. The interconnections between all the characters slowly become apparent until you can’t wait to find out ‘who did it’. </p>
          <p>I am still not quite sure of one or two of the threads as it was a very complicated story and I would not say it was funny - in fact most of the characters are rather sad or miserable.</em></p>

        <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
        <p><em>This book made me chuckle and smile! Much needed at the moment. There are many characters in the story and it moves along at a pace but the fantastic descriptions quickly make you feel that you know the main character, Jackson Brodie and his family and dog (‘ with rusty hips’). Because there are SO many characters it takes a while for all the strands to become woven together. Time is always shifting and you need to read large chunks at a time to keep up with the many story lines and events which often go back in time to give a different perspective.</p>
          <p>I loved many of the phrases that Kate Atkinson uses throughout the book...’...he couldn’t get the knowledge to rise up from the seabed of his memory - a dismal place with the rusting wreckage and detritus of his brain cells.’</p>
          <p>I actually ‘read’ this book as an audiobook and think that it probably worked better because there is so much dialogue and every word needs to be read and absorbed or you will miss vital threads. The downside is that I wanted to annotate the page on several occasions when reading the quiet musings of Jackson and the humour with his son.</p>
          <p>A good mystery story incorporating some serious issues. </em></p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>The blurb for this book talks about Jackson Brodie's life not really going anywhere until he has a chance meeting with a man on a cliff top. That meeting doesn't happen until 150 pages in, so it's fair to say that there's a fair amount of not much happening. Then, when the action does get underway it's short segments that bounce among the different characters (three of whom die in about as many pages at one point!).</p>
        <p> I liked the premise, but it felt more like a screenplay than a book, almost serialised, with a huge cast of people who would get a small mention in the credits at the end. Hmm...</p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>It took a while for me to get into this book.  I felt frustrated at how many people were introduced at the beginning, thought I was never going to keep up.  Once it levelled out a bit, I was not surprised by the book, the outcome was where it was heading all along, there were no last minute surprises.  It was nice that it was set in Yorkshire.  I felt the end was rushed, like it tried to tie up loose ends quickly without much explanation.  Not my favourite book but from half way in it was a page turner.</p>
