          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>Two women, bound by a child, and a secret that will change everything...</p>
          <p>London, 1754. Six years after leaving her illegitimate daughter Clara at London's Foundling Hospital, Bess Bright returns to reclaim the child she has never known. Dreading the worst, that Clara has died in care, Bess is astonished to be told she has already claimed her. Her life is turned upside down as she tries to find out who has taken her little girl - and why. </p>
          <p>Less than a mile from Bess's lodgings in the city, in a quiet, gloomy townhouse on the edge of London, a young widow has not left the house in a decade. When her close friend - an ambitious young doctor at the Foundling Hospital - persuades her to hire a nursemaid for her daughter, she is hesitant to welcome someone new into her home and her life. But her past is threatening to catch up with her and tear her carefully constructed world apart. From the bestselling author of The Familiars comes this captivating story of mothers and daughters, class and power, and love against the greatest of odds ... </p>

          <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
            <p>I really fancied another historical novel after enjoying Hamnet so much. The first chapter is very gripping - I think you'll enjoy this read!</p>

             <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
               <p><em>I really enjoyed The Foundling! It’s a really easy read that keeps you hooked the whole way through. I always love a book that takes you into a different place and lets you walk around in the characters’ shoes and this one definitely does that. It centres around Bess Bright, a young woman who works as a shrimper (she sells shrimp!) in 18th century London. Bess becomes pregnant after meeting Daniel Callard, but is forced to leave her child at the Founding Hospital as she cannot afford to keep her. Six years after dropping her off, Bess returns to claim her daughter, only to find out that she has already been claimed and supposedly by her! </p>
                 <p>This book is all about motherhood and the different ways one can be a mother. You may think that Bess giving up her child to the Foundling Hospital on the day she was born makes her a poor mother, but she fights for over six years to get her back. I found it incredibly sad to think that she and her family were living in such poverty despite working six days a week that they could not afford to keep the baby. On the other hand, Alexandra can give her everything; she has a warm bed, good food and lots of toys. Nevertheless, she lacks the warmth of a mother’s love and cannot give Charlotte the experiences she craves. I feel that Stacey Halls guides the reader to feel that what Bess can give is superior, despite her lack of material goods, but we are never led to hate Alexandra. I felt that the ending to the book, although rather predictable and a bit cheesy, allowed both women to be the best mothers they could be, and I felt that Charlotte was a very lucky girl, to have the best from both. </p>
                 <p>As well as the main characters being interesting, I particularly enjoyed getting to know the minor characters. For example, Ambrosia encourages her sister to take in the child because she thinks she can give her a better life than a life in the Foundling Hospital. Keziah lives in fear of her children being taken from her so keeps them safe in her gaze at all times. Ned acts out of desperation, through addiction and fear, which become more powerful than his feelings for his family. And Lyle, although a late-arriving character to the book, feels so familiar and likeable and is able to give Bess the happy ending she deserves. 18th century London was clearly depicted and proved a fascinating backdrop for the characters’ lives. </p>
                 <p>Overall, this was a great book which didn’t take too long to read, but which left me wanting more. I will definitely read more of Stacey Halls’ books!

             <p>-----</p>
           <p>These feminine vessels we inhabited: why did nobody expect them to contain unfeminine feelings? Why could we, too, not be furious and scornful and entirely altered by grief? Why must we accept the cards we had been dealt?</em></p>
