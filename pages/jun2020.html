          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>Three generations of Palestinian-American women living in Brooklyn are torn between individual desire and the strict mores of Arab culture in this heart-wrenching story of love, intrigue and courage.</p>
          <p>Palestine, 1990. Seventeen-year-old Isra prefers reading books to entertaining the suitors her father has chosen for her. Over the course of a week, the naive and dreamy girl finds herself quickly betrothed and married, and is soon living in Brooklyn. There Isra struggles to adapt to the expectations of her oppressive mother-in-law Fareeda and strange new husband Adam, a pressure that intensifies as she begins to have children - four daughters instead of the sons Fareeda tells Isra she must bear.</p>
          <p>Brooklyn, 2008. Eighteen-year-old Deya, Isra's oldest daughter, must meet with potential husbands at her grandmother Fareeda's insistence, though her only desire is to go to college. But her grandmother is firm on the matter: the only way to secure a worthy future for Deya is through marriage to the right man.</p>
          <p>But fate has a will of its own, and soon Deya will find herself on an unexpected path that leads her to shocking truths about her family...</p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
              <p>When I read the blurb of this book, I was immediately reminded of one of my favourite books from my schooldays, A Thousand Splendid Suns by Khaled Hosseini. I then saw a couple of reviews, which made the same link, so I am hopeful that this is going to be a similarly powerful book.<p>
              <p>Dealing with three generations of women and the family and cultural pressures they face, Etaf Rum gives a voice to the previously unheard.</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>My initial response to the subject matter of this book is one of disbelief; I find it hard to imagine that women are suffering like Isra around the world in the ways described in this book, and yet that is why Etaf Rum has written it. The shockingly recent dates, with much of the book set in the 1990s and 2000s, confirm that Rum isn’t talking about how things used to be for women in many cultures, but how they still are. A Woman is No Man gives a strong insight into the lives of three generations of women, through the characters of Fareeda, Isra and Deya, and the expectations placed upon them and, very importantly, gives them a voice. Through tackling difficult matters such as arranged marriages, domestic abuse and self-acceptance, this book will hopefully increase reader awareness and give some a mirror through which they may be able to question their own experiences or those around them.</p>
                <p>I was aware while reading the book that my own views on arranged marriages were bound to cloud my overall judgement and I knew I would find myself siding with the dispossessed women against their patriarchal society. The book had a strong and single-minded agenda, and I am aware of its portrayal of Arab culture and particularly Arab males in a very negative light. As well as giving some women hope, I do wonder whether there is a risk that many readers will have a renewed negative view of the entire culture, and worry that this may contribute to future xenophobia. Certainly, I cannot see any positives from the portrayal of Arab culture in this book, and the conclusion seems to be very much in favour of Americanism, which feels one sided.</p>
                <p>The last chapter was a little unexpected and provided one of the few more nuanced parts of the book. We are never told whether the scene of Isra and her daughters in the train station actually happened and was the final straw that led to Adam acting as he did, or whether this was a fictional new chapter written by Deya for her mother, in which they escaped and moved towards the “happily ever after” ending that Isra had dreamed of. The empowering of Deya not only enabled her to pursue her dreams, by going to college and writing her story, but could therefore have effectively freed Isra, through realising the strength in her character and giving her a new ending. Although Rum doesn’t give us any idea which is the case, this helps add another dimension to the empowerment of women, indicating that it is not too late for older generations to break free, and that the younger generation will help them do it. Perhaps this mirrors Rum’s intention for her book and the impact it will have on all generations of readers. It has certainly left me thinking!</em></p>

          <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
          <p><em>This story is told by 3 generations of Muslim women from 1990 to 2009, some of whom stay in Palestine and some who move to America in search of a better life. Ultimately, it is a harrowing depiction of the mental and physical abuse these women suffer as they obey the religious, cultural and traditional demands of the dominant males in the family. The stigma of good reputation and family honour must be maintained at all times. It was very much that ' a women's place is in her home'.</p>
          <p> I found the forced marriages and the pressure put on very young women to bear male babies was the most desperate part of this book.The families are poor and severe depression is dismissed as 'the jinn' or curse so not treated.  A glimmer of hope for the future arises as one grandaughter dares to assert her own choices over her life. This book has the most heart rending conclusion of any novel I've read.</em></p>

        <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
        <p><em>I found this book hard to get into at first, but once I was in I was hooked.  It is a very sad and desperate story. I found it shocking how recent the story is pitched; as a Western woman I like to believe that women are not living this life any more, especially when they have moved to a “free” country.</p>
          <p> It really doesn’t portray Arab men in a good light .... Adam did have a lot of pressure on him and I could see why he turned to drink! Obviously that's not an excuse for his behaviour towards Isra. Nadine seemed to know how to work the system, or was it just that she had sons? I got the impression that she would beat her husband if he laid a finger on her! </p>
          <p>Weird ending - it confused me - but I think that was Deya writing her own story, as she said she would when stood in the library.</p>
          <p>A heart breaking story but a good read. Leaves you wondering when life can change for women still existing in these arrangements.<p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>I really enjoyed this book, despite the harrowing content and the challenge of realising that this kind of abuse still prevails. The violence suffered by the women is terrible, but I also found myself sympathising with the men who are equally trapped by the expectations of their culture. The clash of American and Palestinian tradition seemed to affect Adam and Isra more than the generations either side, as they were the couple most caught between two worlds. I found that tension to be the strongest - trying to for a square peg into a round hole in a way they never managed to do. The early descriptions of Isra's childhood seemed to be the happiest times of her life, in spite of the poverty and domestic violence, perhaps showing as well that whatever the cultural backdrop, age only ever makes us more aware of the failings of our society and ways of living. </p>
