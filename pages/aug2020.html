          <h3><b>SYNOPSIS</b></h3>
          <p>Alice Wright marries handsome American Bennett Van Cleve hoping to escape her stifling life in England.  But small-town Kentucky quickly proves equally claustrophobic, especially living alongside her overbearing father-in-law. So when a call goes out for a team of women to deliver books as part of Eleanor Roosevelt’s new traveling library, Alice signs on enthusiastically.</p>
          <p>The leader, and soon Alice’s greatest ally, is Margery, a smart-talking, self-sufficient woman who’s never asked a man’s permission for anything. They will be joined by three other singular women who become known as the Packhorse Librarians of Kentucky. </p>
          <p>What happens to them–and to the men they love–becomes an unforgettable drama of loyalty, justice, humanity and passion. These heroic women refuse to be cowed by men or by convention. And though they face all kinds of dangers in a landscape that is at times breathtakingly beautiful, at others brutal, they’re committed to their job: bringing books to people who have never had any, arming them with facts that will change their lives.</p>
          <p>Based on a true story rooted in America’s past, The Giver of Stars is unparalleled in its scope and epic in its storytelling. Funny, heartbreaking, enthralling, it is destined to become a modern classic–a richly rewarding novel of women’s friendship, of true love, and of what happens when we reach beyond our grasp for the great beyond. </p>

              <h3><b>WHY PICK THIS BOOK?</b></h3>
              <p>We've read some pretty heavy and serious books in the past few months, so I'm looking forward to reading something a little more light-hearted. The idea of a group of women fighting against convention to bring books to those who need them sounds like the ideal book for Lucy Reads!</p>

              <h3><b>LUCY'S REVIEW</b></h3>
              <p><em>This is a great holiday read and I can see why it has been so popular! The characters Jojo Moyes creates are so relatable and as you hear about their lives and picture the library, you really feel that you are one of them. I loved the character of Margery - there’s something so exciting about her refusal to conform to expectations of women, but also the strength of her relationship with Sven and her showing that, even in those times, it was possible to have a job and a family and thrive. I really felt that Margery’s conviction of character rubbed off on Alice throughout her time in Baileyville. In one sense, it was sad that Alice had to suffer so much at the hands of the Van Cleves and I would have loved to scoop her up and protect her from it all, but in another, I was pleased that she gained a real sense of self throughout the book, built strong relationships with people who liked her for who she was, and really stood up for her friends and her beliefs. </p>
                <p>I was amazed to read at the end of the book that Packhorse Libraries did exist in the mid-20th century and that they were indeed organised by women. Moyes gives us a sense of the challenge this posed for many rural communities, who disapproved of young women riding all day to deliver books, sometimes in the most difficult terrains and weather conditions. The work that these women did in bringing books and, in a wider sense, opportunities for education to rural communities, and particularly to women, was incredible, and I found myself imagining what it must have been like to be a packhorse librarian at that time. The joy of reading and talking about books is something that is captured beautifully in The Giver of Stars and which I think the members of Lucy Reads can all relate!</em></p>

          <p><em>I enjoyed the rapport between the girls and how kind they were to everyone in their local area, even those who others thought worthless. They really stood by each other in troublesome times. I hated reading about the Van Cleves and how bitter they were towards Alice. It’s no wonder it didn’t work out! I thought The Giver of Stars was a really good book and I would definitely recommend it!</em></p>

        <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
        <p>‘This town could polish a piece of gossip and preserve it like an insect in amber.’ (p266)</p>
        <p><em>The Giver of Stars is based on a true story, well written and researched. It takes place in the 30’s Depression and is the story of five extraordinary characters in small town Kentucky. We can relate to the Packhorse Librarians, as they become known, but also be inspired by them because of their strength, friendship and courage. Tension builds throughout the book and you feel yourself willing the female characters to succeed in their plight.</p>
        <p>A book of love, humour and heartache. Compelling!</p>

      <h3><b>READERS' REVIEWS</b></h3>
      <p><em>I found this book took a while to warm up for me. I love that it was based on an organisation that really existed. The women must have been so brave to deal with the terrain, the weather and also mens’ opinion of them.</p>
        <p>I loved Margery, she was my hero in this book. It reminded me of Little Women with a twist of Charles/Diana/Camilla ... Felt like a holiday romance that went badly wrong. I was so pleased Alice got a happy ending.</p>
